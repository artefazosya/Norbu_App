## First open/Onboarding

## Event funnel
{% include event_funnel_breathe.html.html %}

8% of people do not proceed from the exercise screen to the exercise itself.

- Idea: less barriers between intention to exercise and the exercise itself: more screens/clicks - more opportunities for the user to change one's mind.
- Recomendation: Remove one screen between choosing the exercise and starting the exercise. There should be just 2 clicks: choose the exercise and start the exercise.

## App removal
Share of users who remove the app is around 50% which corresponds to average uninstall rate in mobile app industry. [Source](https://www.mobileappdaily.com/reduce-mobile-app-uninstall-rates). That's why I did not dig into reasons of app removal, as the rate is pretty normal. I think it's better to concentrate on inactive users - they might still return to the app.

## Inactive users
I decided to consider users who haven't used an app for more than 10 days - inactive users.
There are around 30% of inactive users.
